# CTFNote - Contribution Guide

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue with the collaborators of this repository before making a change.

## Git process

In order to push new code on this repository, you first have to create a new fork within your github workspace.

Once your fork is created (`https://github.com/<your_username>/CTFNote`), you can create a new branch starting with the associated issue number in the name and start working on it.

> If you start from scratch and no issues are associated with your changes, you can create a branch starting with '0-'.

```shell
$ git checkout -b <issue-number>-<branch-name>
```

Examples of branch name:

- `132-add-new-feature`
- `343-add-past-ctf-role`
- `13-fix-bug-in-password-reset`
- `37-leak-flag-to-TFNS`
- `0-contribution-guide`

Once you think the job is done, issue the pull request and target the **main** branch of the official CTFNote repository.

You can also create the pull request before finishing the job but don't forget to add "WiP: " as a suffix in the title to let the collaborators know you are still working on the request.
