## Installation

Use the provided docker configuration to deploy the project:

```shell
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Then, visit 127.0.0.1 and create your first account, which will automatically be provided with admin privileges

You can optionally edit the API configuration file depending on your needs:

[API Configuration File](./api/src/config/globals.ts)

## External Authentication

TODO

## Privileges

* ADMIN_ALL: can create CTFs, tasks, edit users/the config. 
* EDIT_CTF: can create and modify CTF information; you should grant this right to
  your captain
* CTF_ALL: can join every CTF; you should grant this right to your team members.
* no privileges: can only view CTFs when invited; this is used for irregular guests.

CTF guests are allowed to create and edit tasks, but not the CTF information. 

## Development

The development server includes a simple HTTP proxy allowing the frontend to access the local API (cf [quasar.conf.js](front/quasar.conf.js)).
Hot reloading is configured on both components as well.

### Setup and launch the frontend

```shell
$ cd front/
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

### Setup and launch the API

```shell
$ cd api/
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
$ MD_PROVIDER=https://ur-codimd-instance-full-url yarn start
```
